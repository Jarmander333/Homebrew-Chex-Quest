# Homebrew-Chex-Quest

A guide on how to install Chex Quest with homebrew on a old/new 3ds/2ds.

## Prerequisites

CFW with Homebrew (I use Luma3ds)

To test if you have CFW hold down the start button while turning on the console, if you get a GM9 windows, you're good to go!

If nothing popped up, and you just booted normally, follow this guide: https://3ds.hacks.guide/get-started

## Needed Files

Download this zip archive:
https://www.mediafire.com/file/9gxho8jrp0xtcw3/chex.zip/file

Download PrBoom3ds:
https://github.com/elhobbs/prboom3ds/releases

Download the .3dsx, .smdh, and .wad files

## Installation

### PrBoom3ds

Install PrBoom3ds:

Put the .3dsx, smdh, and the prboom.wad (prboom.wad from the.zip file that we downloaded in the beginning) files in /3ds/prboom3ds

Launch the Homebrew application, and there should be a new entry for "PrBoom3ds"

### Chex Quest

Install Chex Quest:

Put the chex.wad file in /3ds/prboom3ds

Rename chex.wad to doom2.wad, and launch prboom3ds from the homebrew menu!

You should now be in Chex Quest!  If you're not... Please make sure you followed this whole thing all the way through.
