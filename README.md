# Homebrew-Chex-Quest

A guide on how to install Chex Quest with homebrew on a old/new 3ds/2ds.

DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOUR DEVICE BECOMES BRICKED / RUINED, IF YOU TRY TO BLAME ME, I WILL LAUGH AT YOU.  

## Prerequisites

CFW with Homebrew (I use Luma3ds)

To test if you have CFW hold down the start button while turning on the console, if you get a GM9 windows, you're good to go!

If nothing popped up, and you just booted normally, follow this guide: https://3ds.hacks.guide/get-started

## Needed Files

Download this zip archive:
https://www.mediafire.com/file/9gxho8jrp0xtcw3/chex.zip/file

Download PrBoom3ds:
https://github.com/elhobbs/prboom3ds/releases

Download the .3dsx, .smdh, and .wad files

## Installation

### PrBoom3ds

Install PrBoom3ds:

Put the .3dsx, smdh, and the prboom.wad (prboom.wad from the.zip file that we downloaded in the beginning) files in /3ds/prboom3ds

Launch the Homebrew application, and there should be a new entry for "PrBoom3ds"

### Chex Quest

Install Chex Quest:

Put the chex.wad file in /3ds/prboom3ds

Rename chex.wad to doom2.wad, and launch prboom3ds from the homebrew menu!

You should now be in Chex Quest!  If you're not... Please make sure you followed this whole thing all the way through.  

#### NOTES:

* You can use PrBoom3ds, or DSDoom (I use both)
* ~~I am not sure if Chex Quest 3 works, but I will test it soon~~ Chex Quest 3 doesn't work
* Thank me for getting it running on 3ds/2ds, but not for the program it runs on, that was all elhobbs
* You can use DSDoom works as well, just put in "doom2.wad" (chex.wad) into the folder where wads go in DSDoom
* Use either PrBoom3ds, or DSDoom depending what you want for it

**DSDoom**

* Pros 
     
     Can have dual screen mode.

     Second screen can display a map, console, or nothing.

* Cons
     
     Uses Doom sound, not Chex Quest sounds.

     Have to select "doom2.wad" from a selection list of wads on every launch.

     Requires a separate launcher called TWilightMenu++ (not going through that because that is outside the scope of this).

**PrBoom3ds**

* Pros

     Uses Chex Quest sounds.

     Will automatically load "doom2.wad" if it is the only wad in the directory (except prboom.wad).

     Launches through Homebrew Launcher (which I have gotton many more things to work on Homebrew than TWilightMenu++).
     
* Cons

     Dual screen, but just a virtual keyboard on the bottom.
     

Bugs:

* Unknown?
